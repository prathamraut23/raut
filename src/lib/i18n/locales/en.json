    "storyTitle": "Our Story: From Helplessness to Empowerment",
    "storySubtitle": "How we reclaimed our value, one orange at a time.",
    "farmerStruggleTitle": "The Farmer's Struggle",
    "farmerStruggleP1": "For decades, our ancestors grew some of the finest oranges in the region. But like many farmers, we had no direct link to the market. Agents controlled everything — the rates, the grading, and even the value of our hard work. They would tell us our oranges were “too small,” the color “wasn’t right,” or the grade was “low.” For the same batch of fruit, we received three or four different prices, leaving farmers confused and helpless.",
    "hiddenMarketTitle": "The Hidden Market",
    "hiddenMarketP1": "What we didn’t know then—but slowly discovered—was how the agents secretly segregated and sold our oranges. The system was designed so that the people who deserved the most didn't profit.",
    "marketBullet1": "High-grade fruit was exported outside India.",
    "marketBullet2": "Medium-grade fruit went to Kashmir, malls, and big markets.",
    "marketBullet3": "Semi-medium fruit was sent to local mandis.",
    "marketBullet4": "The lowest-grade fruit went for juice or peel powder.",
    "hiddenMarketP2": "They even stored fruit in cold storage for a month and sold it later at double the price. From every grade, they made more profit than the farmers who worked under the sun all year.",
    "turningPointTitle": "The Turning Point: Knowledge is Power",
    "turningPointP1": "As we studied the orange market across India, one truth became clear: farmers were losing because we didn’t have access to grading, sorting, processing, or storage. The knowledge was hidden from us.",
    "turningPointP2": "But step by step, we learned. We learned how to grade. We learned how to sort. We learned how to wash and wax. We learned how the market truly works. And with this knowledge, we made a powerful decision — farmers must stand together.",
    "movementTitle": "The Birth of a Movement",
    "movementP1": "This realization led to the creation of Raut Farmer Producer Company. A platform built by farmers, for farmers. A place where we process our own oranges, set fair prices, reduce wastage, and capture the profit that once disappeared into the pockets of middlemen. Today, many farmers who join us earn better, feel empowered, and finally receive the respect their hard work deserves.",
    "movementQuote": "\"We are not just an orange company. We are a movement — a journey of learning, unity, and reclaiming our value.\"",
